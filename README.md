## Setup

1. [Use this template](https://github.com/jacklynrose/go-go-go/generate)
2. Clone your new repository
3. `yarn` to install dependancies
4. Add packages, apps, services, etc. same as you would a new project but no need for installing dev tools!

## Adding your own code

_TODO_: explain how to create a package/app/service

### TypeScript

You'll need to include a `tsconfig.json` in any packages you make. It's recommended to inherit from the root `tsconfig.json` file.

### Jest & Testing

_TODO_
